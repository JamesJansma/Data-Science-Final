# Data-Science-Final
This project is the final for a data science. In the project I take workout data that I have gathered over the past months
and I then perform edata analysis, hypothesis test, and classification with the data set. This is done by combinging two other 
tables with the data one that included the days and months that the dates occured in and the other has weather data 
through the range of dates I have. 

## How to use the project
Everything is ready to run if you pull down all the files except for the weather API. So if you would like to run the weather API your going to need
to get an API key from rapid api specifically the [Meto Stat](https://rapidapi.com/meteostat/api/meteostat/) api. This is not needed to run the project 
however as the spokane weather data is already provided meaning that this can run for looking at my data analysis.
